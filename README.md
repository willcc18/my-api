# üéØ Goal

We want to deploy the API inside our container to the cloud so that anybody can access it! [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run?hl=en) on GCP allows you to deploy containerized applications in a fully managed environment. You package your code in a Docker container, upload it to GCP, and Cloud Run handles scaling, load balancing, and HTTPS. It abstracts away infrastructure management letting you focus on code.

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment

1. Setup your `.env` here you can duplicate the `.env.example` and rename it to `.env` and fill in the `DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME`! Pick a name which pushes to the artifact registry you setup before!

2. Setup the makefile with the following commands:
    ```bash
    build_docker_image:
        build the container using DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME

    run_docker_image:
        run the container using DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME

    push_docker_image:
        push the container using DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME
    ```
    For run_docker_image make sure you can access the API locally on localhost:8000!

3. On a Cloud Run deployment we can't hardcode the port, this is because GCP doesn't know what port it will run your service on until runtime! You will need to add a `PORT` variable to the `.env` file and use it in the Dockerfile! Don't forget to update the `docker run` command in the makefile to use the `PORT` variable! Passing it as an environment variable in your Dockerfile's `CMD` instruction.

    <summary markdown='span'>üí° Solution</summary>

    In `makefile`:
    ```bash
    -e PORT=${PORT}
    ```

    In `Dockerfile`:
    ```Dockerfile
    CMD uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
    ```

    Docker might warn you that the `CMD` arguments are not as JSON arguments. That's fine. When `CMD` arguments are NOT put in an array, a shell is invoked to execute your command. When we put arguments in an array like `CMD ['uvicorn', 'app.main:app', ...]`, Docker is NOT invoking a shell, and therefore can't process environment variables.

    </details>

4. Add one last command to the makefile:
    ```bash
    deploy_docker_image:
        deploy
    ```

    Using the [Cloud Run documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/run/deploy) make sure to allow unauthenticated invocations so you can access your class mates API's!

It might take a few minutes for your API to be provisioned on Cloud Run and assigned a URL. Once it's up and active, anyone in the world should be able to access it if they have the URL! üéâ

# üèÅ Finished

We have now set up a basic deployment! But we want to add CI/CD in our next exercise in to implement best practices like testing and automated deployment!
